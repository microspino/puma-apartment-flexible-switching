  # In order to migrate all of your Tenants you need to provide a list of Tenant names to Apartment.
  # You can make this dynamic by providing a Proc object to be called on migrations.
  # This object should yield either:
  # - an array of strings representing each Tenant name.
  # - a hash which keys are tenant names, and values custom db config (must contain all key/values required in database.yml)
  #
  # config.tenant_names = lambda{ Customer.pluck(:tenant_name) }

  # Apartment.switch("some_tenant"){ ... }, Apartment passes "some_tenant" to
  # the selected resolver (after it's been decorated). The Database resolver
  # takes the decorated tenant name, and inserts it into the :database key of a
  # full connection specification (the full spec is whatever the database spec
  # was at Apartment initialization. The schema resolver, does the same but
  # for the :schema_search_path option in the configuration.
